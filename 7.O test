Hello, this is a message of security. Hasco here. I have made all member discussions private except for me.
Non-Members will be able to see authorized updates to see the cool things we do!
From this point, we can make a few files open source if we feel like it and put them on GitHub to see if others can help.
We could possibly take in a few people. Just a recommendation!
